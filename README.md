# DYJ Withdrawal Plan

This is a Forex trading robot developed by Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to open and close positions at trend turning points, providing a withdrawal plan for traders. The code is written in MQL4 language and can be used on the MetaTrader 4 platform.

## How it works

The DYJ Withdrawal Plan robot uses a list of 10 currency pairs to analyze the market and identify trend turning points. It opens positions when the current price exceeds the previous price and closes positions when the current price reverses.

### Opening positions

For each currency pair in the symbolArray, the robot compares the current price with the previous price. If the current price is higher, a buy position is opened. The lot size is calculated based on the account's free margin and the margin required for the symbol. The stop loss is set 30 points below the current price, and the take profit is set 60 points above the current price. The position is only opened if the lot size, stop loss, and take profit are all valid.

If the current price is lower than the previous price, a sell position is opened. The lot size, stop loss, and take profit are calculated in the same way as for the buy position.

### Closing positions

The robot iterates through all open positions and checks if the symbol is one of the three major currency pairs: EURUSD, GBPUSD, or USDJPY. If it is, the robot compares the current price with the previous price. If the position is a buy position and the current price is lower than the previous price, or if the position is a sell position and the current price is higher than the previous price, the position is closed at the current price.

### Displaying trading information

The robot also displays basic trading information such as the account balance, equity, and profit. The account profit is calculated as the difference between the equity and the balance.
